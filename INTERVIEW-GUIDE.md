# 🎤 Interview Guide: Extracting Your Expertise

Use these questions for each skill you're building. You don't need to write perfectly — just get your knowledge down. Messy notes, dot points, voice memos transcribed — all fine. The structure comes later when you fill in the template.

## The Process Questions

**Walk me through it step by step.** When a client comes to you for [this topic], what's the very first thing you do? Then what? Walk through the entire process from start to finish as if you're explaining it to a smart new hire on their first day.

**What information do you need before you start?** What must you know from the client before you can begin this part of the planning? What happens if they don't have that information yet?

**What tools/documents/templates do you use?** Any spreadsheets, checklists, software, or documents you always pull out for this stage?

## The Secret Sauce Questions 🌶️

**What do less experienced planners always get wrong here?** Think about the mistakes you used to make, or that you see others make. What do you know now that you wish you knew then?

**What's your rule of thumb / benchmark / magic number?** Any percentages, timeframes, ratios, or pricing benchmarks you use as mental shortcuts? (e.g. "Venue should never exceed X% of budget", "Always add X minutes buffer for Y")

**What do you always check that others forget?** The thing you've learned the hard way to look for. The question you always ask that surprises clients or vendors.

**What's your negotiation or communication tactic here?** How do you handle the tricky conversations — pricing pushback, difficult clients, vendor issues? What's your actual language or approach?

**What are the regional/seasonal patterns you've noticed?** Things that are specific to the areas you work in, or patterns that shift with seasons that someone new wouldn't know.

## The Real-World Questions

**Give me an example of when this went perfectly.** A real scenario (names changed) where your process worked exactly as it should. What made it work?

**Give me an example of when this went wrong.** A real scenario where something unexpected happened. What went wrong, how did you recover, and what did you change in your process because of it?

**What are the top 3 things that can go wrong at this stage?** And what's your playbook for each one?

---

## The Decision Tree Questions

**When do you say no / redirect / escalate?** Are there situations where you handle this differently? Red flags that change your approach? Thresholds where you bring in extra help?

**How does this change based on the type of wedding?** Think about how your approach differs for: intimate vs. large, budget-conscious vs. luxury, local vs. destination, cultural/religious considerations, weekday vs. weekend.

## How to Use This Guide

You have two options:

**Option A (Solo):** Read each question, write your answers. Don't overthink it. Spend 20-30 minutes per skill.

**Option B (Interview Style):** Have someone ask you these questions out loud while you talk through your answers. Record it or have them take notes. This is usually faster and more natural — you'll say things you wouldn't think to write.

Once you have your answers, open **[templates/TEMPLATE.md](./templates/TEMPLATE.md)** and organise them into the skill format.
