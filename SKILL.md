# Client Intake & Consultation

## What You Need Before Starting
Before the first consultation, gather the basics via an intake form or brief phone call so the meeting itself is productive. You need at minimum: both partners' names, proposed date (or season/year if flexible), estimated guest count range, ballpark budget range (even if "not sure yet"), and how they found you.

## Instructions

Step 1: **Set the tone in the first 5 minutes.** Start with casual conversation — how they met, what excites them about the wedding. This isn't filler; it tells you their communication style, who the primary decision-maker is, and what they actually care about versus what they think they should care about. Listen more than you talk.

Step 2: **Qualify the engagement.** Before diving into planning, confirm the three non-negotiables: date, guest count range, and budget range. If they say "we haven't thought about budget," use the anchoring technique — "Most weddings for [X guests] in [region] typically range from $[low] to $[high]. Does that feel roughly right, or are you thinking something different?" This gives them permission to share a number without feeling judged.

Step 3: **Map their priorities.** Ask: "If you could only have three things be absolutely perfect on your wedding day, what would they be?" Their answer tells you where to allocate budget and attention. Common answers: food/drink, photography, venue/atmosphere, music, flowers. Rarely: stationery, favours, transport. Allocate accordingly.

Step 4: **Identify hidden stakeholders.** Ask who else is involved in decision-making. Parents contributing financially? A bridal party with strong opinions? Cultural or religious requirements from family? These hidden stakeholders cause 80% of mid-planning surprises. Surface them now.

Step 5: **Set expectations clearly.** Walk through your working style: communication frequency, response times, what decisions they need to make and by when, and what your role is vs. what's on them. The number one cause of client dissatisfaction is mismatched expectations, not bad planning.

Step 6: **Outline next steps with a timeline.** Before they leave, they should know exactly what happens next and when. "I'll send you a proposal by [date]. Once signed, our first working session will be [topic]. Between now and then, I need you to [specific homework]."

## Secret Sauce 🌶️

**The "Tell Me About the Worst Wedding You've Been To" question.** Ask this casually. Their answer reveals their actual fears and non-negotiables far more honestly than "what's your vision?" They'll say things like "the food was terrible and we waited two hours for photos" — now you know food quality and timeline efficiency are their real priorities, even if their Pinterest board is all about florals.

**The budget conversation hack.** Clients almost always understate their budget by 15-25%. Don't plan to their stated number — plan to 85% of it. This gives you a buffer for the inevitable scope creep and means you're never the one delivering bad news about overages.

**Reading the room on who's driving.** Within 10 minutes you can tell who the primary planner is. Direct 60% of your eye contact and logistical questions to that person, but make sure the other partner feels included in the creative/vision questions. If there's visible tension about budget, flag it privately with the primary contact later — never in the room together.

**The 48-hour follow-up rule.** Send a personalised follow-up within 48 hours of the consultation. Include 2-3 specific things they said that you remembered. "I loved your idea about [X]" or "I've been thinking about how to incorporate [Y] and I have some ideas." This is when they're deciding between you and other planners, and personal attention wins every time.

## Decision Tree

**If budget is under $[your-region-threshold]:** Be honest early about what's realistic. Show them a sample breakdown at their budget level. Some clients will adjust up; others will confirm the budget and appreciate your honesty. Never let them proceed with unrealistic expectations.

**If it's a destination wedding:** Add 20 minutes to the consultation for logistics discussion. Identify immediately: how many guests are traveling, who's managing accommodation blocks, and whether legal requirements in the destination have been researched.

**If there are cultural/religious ceremony requirements:** Ask which traditions are non-negotiable vs. which are "nice to have." Get the officiant or religious leader's contact early — their requirements often dictate venue, timing, and day-of flow more than anything else.

**If the couple is under 25 or this is a second wedding:** Adjust your language. Younger couples respond to collaborative energy ("let's build this together"). Second-wedding couples want efficiency and sophistication — they know what they want and don't need hand-holding on basics.

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Couple said "no budget" — actually meant $40K
**Situation:** Couple came in saying "money isn't really an issue, we just want it to be beautiful." Showed them venues in the $15-20K range. They went quiet. Turned out their actual total budget was $40K — "money isn't an issue" meant "we don't want to think about it," not "unlimited."
**What we did:** Pivoted to the anchoring technique. Showed them three budget tiers with sample breakdowns. They immediately pointed to the middle tier and said "that's more what we were thinking." Crisis averted in 10 minutes.
**Result:** Planned a beautiful $42K wedding. They were happy because expectations were set correctly from day one. No budget surprises.

### Example 2: Mother of the bride was the real client
**Situation:** Couple seemed easygoing and low-key. Three weeks in, the bride's mother started sending emails directly with completely different ideas — bigger, more formal, different colour palette. Bride was caught in the middle.
**What we did:** Should have caught this in the consultation. Now we always ask "Is anyone else contributing financially, and if so, do they have expectations about how that contribution translates to input?" Scheduled a three-way call to align everyone.
**Result:** Resolved, but cost two weeks of replanning. Now this question is in Step 4 of every intake, every time.

## What Can Go Wrong

### Problem: Client ghosts after consultation
**Why it happens:** They're shopping around, got overwhelmed, or the budget conversation scared them off.
**How to handle it:** One follow-up at 48 hours, one at one week. If no response, send a brief "no pressure" message at two weeks: "Just checking in — happy to chat if you have questions, and no hard feelings if you've gone in a different direction." Never chase beyond this.

### Problem: Couple disagrees on vision during the meeting
**Why it happens:** They haven't talked about it properly before coming to you. Very common.
**How to handle it:** Don't take sides. Say "It sounds like you're both excited about different elements — that's really normal. What I usually find is that [compromise approach]. Want me to put together two mood boards so you can each see the other's vision brought to life?"

### Problem: Client wants to book immediately without hearing your pricing
**Why it happens:** They're excited, or they've already decided and just want to get started.
**How to handle it:** Never let someone sign without seeing full pricing and terms. Say "I'd love to work with you and I can feel the excitement — let me send you the detailed proposal tonight so you can review it properly. I want you to feel 100% confident." Protects you legally and builds trust.

## Red Flags & Boundaries

**Red flag:** One partner visibly disengaged or resentful during the consultation. This couple may have unresolved relationship issues that will surface as planning stress. Proceed with care and build in more check-in points than usual.

**Red flag:** Client says they've already fired a previous planner. Ask (gently) what went wrong. If their complaints sound unreasonable, this client may be difficult to satisfy. Consider whether you want the engagement.

**Red flag:** Budget expectations are wildly misaligned with their vision. If they want a $100K wedding on a $30K budget and won't budge on either number, it's better to decline gracefully than to take the job and be the bearer of constant bad news.
